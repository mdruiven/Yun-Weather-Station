 * Source code taken from Internet of Things with the Arduino Yun by Marco Schwartz
 * and Save Arduino Yun data to a spreadsheet at https://temboo.com/arduino/yun/update-google-spreadsheet
 * Build a weather station using a photoresistor for light level and a DHT22 for temperature and humidity.
 * Logs data from station to google spreadheet
yun1_sensorTest will work in an Arduino Uno or Yun and tests the operation of the photoresistor to measure light level and the DHT22 to measure temperature and humidity.
yun2_2_temboolog logs the data onto a Google spreadsheet. This program requires the TembooAccount.h file with your information entered.
